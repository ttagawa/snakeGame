This is my version of the classic snake game.  Use WASD for movement controls.  Eating the good apple increments score by 1 and snake length by 1.  Eating the rotten apple decrements the score by 1 and snake length by 1.  Rotten apple eventually decomposes(moves offscreen), but it comes back on screen later.  If any part of the snake collides with the wall, itself, or the raining poop then the game starts over.
